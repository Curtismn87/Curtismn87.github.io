As a user -

1. I want to be able see how many guesses I have made during the game
2. I want to play again once my game is over
3. I want to pick how many cards I have to match
4. I want to be able to play against my friends
5. I want to see how many times I have won

-- Wasn't able to implement (3) choosing how many cards to match or (4) play against my friends

Spent a lot of time fixing problems in the javascript and preventing users from being able to
break the program. There are still some minor errors that I know about (proably more that I don't know about)
but was able to fix most of the issues that arose.
